This is Anshunkang Zhou's homepage! I am a Ph.D student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Charles Zhang. My research focuses on enhancing software security through both dynamic and static techniques, such as fuzzing (S&P'24) and binary analysis (ASPLOS'24, ASPLOS'25, TOSEM'24).
